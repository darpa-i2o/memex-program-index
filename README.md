A list of memex-related tools and their repository URLs

## Crawlers

### Web Page Classifiers
[https://github.com/Sotera/page-class] (page-class).
In development: a tool to classify web pages into categories used by MEMEX such as blog|wiki|news|forum|classified|shopping. Testing several approaches and subsystems including `webpageclassifier`, below. Includes simple web app with JSON and HTML interfaces.

`webpageclassifier`: Categorizes urls as one of: blog|wiki|news|forum|classified|shopping|undecided. Manually-created if-then rules (decision tree) intended as a quick first-pass.
